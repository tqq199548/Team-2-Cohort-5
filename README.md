# **Project Background**
**Why is Pharmaceutical Drug Spending Important?**

Pharmaceutical spending is a key component of healthcare expenditure worldwide. It represents the cost incurred by individuals, governments, and insurance providers on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and self-medication.
In recent years, rising drug costs have raised concerns regarding:
Affordability: Higher drug prices make essential medications inaccessible to lower-income populations.
Healthcare Policy: Policymakers and governments aim to balance innovation incentives for pharmaceutical companies while regulating costs.
Economic Burden: Pharmaceutical spending impacts GDP, public health budgets, and insurance systems.
